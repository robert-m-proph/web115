				<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>   I was in the United States Army for six years. I was a Cavalry Scout | Recon. After 
					I got out, I worked for Time Warner Cable for three years as a technician. I met a ton of people who pushed me into the direction 
					of being a programmer. Since then, I have made it my absolute goal to become just that. I spend a lot of time outside regular school 
					hours, homework, etc. creating, practicing, and working on code. I work with a mentor of mine, mostly working in Python and back-end programming. 
					I also coach youth football. We are currently the 2018 and 2019 local champions. We are also the 2019 Regional Champions. Go MARA!!</li>
